                  It was developed in my spare time during lockdown, I started development around the end of April
                  and released it on the Google Play Store on the 17th of June. The game play is very simplistic and
                  arcadey
                  and was designed to be picked up and put down easily.

         Hi I'm Alex, and as you might have learnt I've recently graduated from Staffordshire University with a Computer
         Games Programming degree.
         Now I'm looking for the next step of my career.

         </figure>
            <p class="ml-3 mr-3">
               I enjoy programming and writing code and love seeing my vision for projects start to take shape (in fact
               that's what I loved about making this portfolio), even if most
               of my projects are still plagued by programmer art, see project pages for examples.
               <br>
               <br>
               Most of my time at university was geared towards the game side of programming. I thoroughly enjoy
               developing interesting ideas and mechanics for all types of games and
               I believe I can bring those interesting ideas and passion to a business environment.
               <br>
               <br>
               I'm most comfortable using C++ and C# and like the experience that Unity provides but I'm open to all
               opportunities and would use any
               chance to expand my existing skillset.
               <br>
               <br>
               I've recently published a mobile game created in the Unity Game Engine, the game is called Chill Pill and
               can be checked out <a
                  href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.AlexGriffin.ChillPill&hl=en_US&gl=US"
                  class="externalLinks">here</a>.
               <br>
               <br>
               During my time training with Sparta Global I have expanded my skillset as well as honed my existing
               skills, I believe this is reflected in my most recent projects listed on this portfolio.
               <br>
               <br>
               In my time with Sparta I learnt a lot about a number of new subjects, frameworks and technologies
               including Entity Framework, ASP.NET, Razor Pages, MVC, WPF, SQL, .NET Core, APIs and Unit testing to name
               a few.
               <br>
               <br>
               My programming as a whole has improved greatly since utilising all of these and i feel I now have a
               deeper understanding and knowledge of how to write good code.
               <br>
               <br>
               To further expand my toolkit I'm looking at learning Javascript to enable me to accomplish more within
               web development, as well as learn Python as it's a very versatile language in addition to having the
               capability and support in developing artificial intelligence and machine learning.
